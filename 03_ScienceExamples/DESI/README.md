# DESI Example Notebooks

The Astro Data Lab includes a collection of notebooks showcasing the DESI data. They are distributed in a few locations as follows.

## This folder: `03_ScienceExamples/DESI/`

- `01_Intro_to_DESI_EDR.ipynb` shows how to access the redshift catalog from the Astro Data Lab database, how to separate objects based on the DESI targeting information, how to access all the available spectra for a given object using [SPARCL (SPectra Analysis and Retrievable Catalog Lab)](https://astrosparcl.datalab.noirlab.edu), and finally how to plot the "best" spectrum.

- `01a_Intro_to_DESI_EDR-Py3.ipynb` is similar to the previous notebook, but installing the DESI software is not required to run this notebook. It uses the Python 3 kernel and shows how to access the DESI EDR redshift catalog from the Astro Data Lab database, how to select sources based on the DESI targeting information, and how to access and plot the required spectra using SPARCL. 

- `02_DESI_EDR_SDSS_Comparison.ipynb` shows how to use SPARCL data discovery to find available SDSS DR16 and DESI EDR spectra of sources in a specific region of the sky with redshift and spectype constraints, how to retrieve and compare spectra for the same galaxy observed with both SDSS and DESI.

## How-to folder: `04_HowTos/`

- `QueryClient/How_to_query_DESI_EDR_Data.ipynb` demonstrates a variety of queries to the Astro Data Lab `desi_edr` database.

- `SPARCL/How_to_use_SPARCL.ipynb` provides a basic introduction to using the SPARCL client (or sparclclient) to find and retrieve spectroscopic data within a Python notebook context. [(SPARCL = SPectra Analysis and Retrievable Catalog Lab)](https://astrosparcl.datalab.noirlab.edu)

### DESI Data Documentation Websites

The [DESI Landing Page](https://datalab.noirlab.edu/desi/index.php) at Astro Data Lab includes a brief overview of DESI and the early data release. The [Data access page](https://datalab.noirlab.edu/desi/access.php) describes multiple ways of accessing data through the Astro Data Lab or SPARCL.

The [DESI Data Documentation website](https://data.desi.lbl.gov/doc/) describes data access, data format, data releases, and includes links to technical papers as well as information on data license and acknowledgments. It is the overriding reference for official DESI information.
