# Brief Description

## 0_GOGREENDr2FileService.ipynb

This notebook uses the file service to give a tour of the available files as part of the GOGREEN DR2 dataset, which includes data from GOGREEN and GCLASS.

## 1_GOGREENDr2DataAccessAtDataLab.ipynb

This notebook is adapted from the original version produced by the GOGREEN survey team. This version loads the catalogs through a TAP service (using simple SQL queries), and accesses all needed data files (FITS files with 1-d and 2-d spectra, images, etc.) through the Data Lab file service for GOGREEN DR2.

## 2_GOGREENDr2SIA.ipynb

This notebook demonstrates how the GOGREEN DR2 images can be queried at Data Lab using the Simple Image Access (SIA) service, and how cutouts around positions on the sky can be retrieved.

## 3_GOGREENDr2ClusterMembership.ipynb

This notebook aims to visualize sky positions and redshifts of galaxies as a function of their cluster membership.

## 4_GOGREENDr2Spec1DRedshift.ipynb

This notebook illustrates 1D and 2D spectrum emission line features and demonstrates how to derive the redshift and equivalent width of the \[O II\]3727 doublet from a Gaussian fit.
