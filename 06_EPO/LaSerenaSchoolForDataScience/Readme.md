**Welcome to the La Serena School for Data Science!**

The "La Serena School for Data Science: Applied tools for Data-driven sciences" is an international program that seeks to introduce advanced undergraduate and early graduate students in data-intensive careers to the computational and statistical tools required to work with large volumes of data. These careers include, but are not limited to, astronomy, physics, biology, medical informatics, computer science, statistics, among others.

The 2019 folder includes the interactive Jupyter Notebooks that were part of the curriculum taught during the 2019 school. Choose a notebook file (ends with .ipynb) in a topic of your interest. Click on it and it will launch in a new Tab in your browser. *This is work in progress. We will be adding more notebooks soon.*

If you have suggestions to make the notebooks better, or if you encounter problems, or if you have inquires about the school, please get in touch with the La Serena School for Data Science through the school website.
