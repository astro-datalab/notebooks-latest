**Welcome to the Teen Astronomy Cafe!**

For information about the program, please visit: http://www.teenastronomycafe.org/
The website includes a list of past Cafes: http://www.teenastronomycafe.org/about.php

This Jupyter Notebook Folder includes interactive Jupyter Notebooks that go along with the Cafes, and is a first "test" version, which we will develop to add more instructions to go along the activities.

Browse the folders to choose an activity to run.

Each folder contains one notebook file (ends with .ipynb). Click on it and it will launch in a new Tab.

 If you have suggestions to make the notebooks better, or if you encounter problems, please get in touch with the Astro Data Lab team: datalab@noirlab.edu
