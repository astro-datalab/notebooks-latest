    "Imagine a particle, located at a distance $r$ from a black-hole of mass $M$ (see picture below). In this module, we will explore the motion of this particle as it orbits around the black-hole, and how this motion can be used to test our understanding of gravity! Along the way, we will learn about *numerical integration*, an important tool that will allow us to use computers to solve equations that are too complicated to solve by hand. \n",

    "We will start with what we know of the laws of gravity (what Newton discovered). Then three basics are needed to understand numerical integration before we apply it to the motion of a particle around a black hole. That has us  exploring numerical integration with respect first to a ball at constant velocity and then to a ball with changing velocity. Then we will explore numerical integration with respect to a ball on a spring. With that information we will be able to see whether Newton's law of gravity (e.g., the gravity we know) will help determine a particle's motion around a black hole or whether the gravitational law of general relativity would be better suited and why.\n",

While you stand on the Earth, gravity, $a$, is always pulling you down toward the center of the Earth. But you might be running forward with a velocity $v$ on the surface of the Earth.
