    "The first definitive planet found around a Sun-like star was found by Didier Queloz and Michel Mayor, earning them the [2019 Nobel prize in Physics](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2019/summary/). Since that time, the number of known planets has grown to 1000s of planets. Now, astronomers are moving beyond discovering planets to learning about their atmospheres. In this \"simulator\" you will be recovering spectra from exoplanet systems to understand what their atmospheres are made of.\n",

In real atmospheres, we will get a mix of molecules that can tell us about the planets' chemistry and someday even help us find life elsewhere in the Universe. Astronomers are exploring real planet atmospheres with current and future telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope. You can read about the Webb Telescope and see Images of it at [jwst.nasa.gov/](https://jwst.nasa.gov/content/features/index.html#educationalFeatures).\n"
