On the other hand, the galaxies in a cluster orbit at speeds greater than expected, and in a way that can be explained if there is a large amount of an unseen material that we call \"dark matter.\" This dark matter turns out to be a more substantial component of the cluster than that of all the stars in all of the member galaxies. Wait - if dark matter is invisible, then how can we see it? Well, just as wind is invisible but we know it is there when it shakes trees, dark matter is also invisible but know it is there because it speeds up the motions of the galaxies. Trying to undertstand what is dark matter is one of the most important questions in all of astronomy and physics."

These lenses take the shape of a galaxy cluster, so they are humongous eyeglasses!  These lenses are not polished like real eyeglasses, and so produce distorted images instead of in-focus ones, and they even make you \"see double.\"  If this happened to a real pair of glasses then you would send them back to the shop.  How does a gravitational lens distort the light?  \n",
