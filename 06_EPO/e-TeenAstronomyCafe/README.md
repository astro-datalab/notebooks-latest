**Welcome to the Teen Astronomy Cafe!**

For information about the program, please visit: http://www.teenastronomycafe.org/  

The website includes a list of past Cafes: http://www.teenastronomycafe.org/about.php  

This folder includes interactive Jupyter Notebooks that go along with the Cafes, and is a first "test" version, which we will develop to add more instructions to go along the activities.  

Browse the folders to choose an activity to run.  

If you want to test the notebooks you can:
