    "1. The finishing time of the simulation (obviously).\n",
    "2. The number of bodies in the simulation. Each step requires $N^2$ calculations, so for a two planet system, there are four calculations required (the star on each planet and each planet on each other) and for an eight planet system, like the Solar System, there are 256.  Fewer planets means a faster simulation.\n",
    "3. The distance of the closest planet to the star.  Because we're approximating the orbits between timesteps, we have to take smaller steps to get a good approximation if there is a close in planet. For instance, if we put Mercury in our simulation, one year requires 83 simulation steps, but if Jupiter is the closest planet to the Sun, one year requires 2 simulation steps. A more distant inner planet means a faster simulation."
