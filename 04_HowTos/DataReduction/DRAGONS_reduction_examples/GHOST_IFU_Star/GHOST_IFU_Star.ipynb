    "# Goals\n",
    "Showcase how to reduce GHOST spectroscopy data using the Gemini DRAGONS package on the Data Lab science platform using a custom DRAGONS kernel `\"DRAGONS-3.2.1 (Py3.10)\"`. The steps include downloading data from the Gemini archive, setting up the DRAGONS calibration service, processing biases, flats, and arcs, creating master flats and slit-flats, reducing the standards and science data, and finally creating the final reduced spectra for GHOST's red and blue arms. \n",
    "\n",

    "<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"summary\"></a>\n",
    "# Summary\n",
    "DRAGONS is a Python-based astronomical data reduction platform written by the Gemini Science User Support Department. It can currently be used to reduce imaging data from Gemini instruments GMOS, NIRI, Flamingos 2, GSAOI, and GNIRS, as well as spectroscopic data taken with GHOST and GMOS in longslit mode. Linked [here](https://dragons.readthedocs.io/en/v3.2.1/) is a general list of guides, manuals, and tutorials about the use of DRAGONS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DRAGONS kernel has been made available in the Data Lab environment, allowing users to access the routines without being dependent on installing the software on their local machines. It is important to note that when a DRAGON command is executed, the output will be displayed inside the cell. Make sure to scroll through the output to ensure no errors are missed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we present an example of a DRAGONS Jupyter notebook that works in the Data Lab environment to reduce Gemini South GHOST blue:2x2 and red:2x2 spectroscopy data fully. This notebook will not present all of the details of the many options available to adjust or optimize the DRAGONS GHOST data reduction process; rather, it will just show one example of a standard reduction of a GHOST spectroscopic dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this notebook example is GHOST blue:2x2 and red:2x2 spectroscopy data from the Gemini archive of the star XX Oph from the GHOST commissioning run. Because the data used is from a commissioning run, there is no program information available, but you can find more information about GHOST's red and blue IFUs on the [GHOST instrument page](https://www.gemini.edu/instrumentation/ghost).\n",
