    "Showcase how to reduce GSAOI imaging data using the Gemini DRAGONS package on the Data Lab science platform using a custom DRAGONS kernel `\"DRAGONS (Py3.7)\"`. The steps include downloading data from the Gemini archive, setting up a DRAGONS calibration service, processing flats, darks, a bad pixel mask, and science frames, and creating a single combined stacked image.\n",

    "<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"summary\"></a>\n",
    "# Summary\n",
    "DRAGONS is a Python-based astronomical data reduction platform written by the Gemini Science User Support Department. It can currently be used to reduce imaging data from Gemini instruments GMOS, NIRI, Flamingos 2, GSAOI, and GNIRS, as well as spectroscopic data in GMOS longslit mode. Linked <a href=\"https://dragons.readthedocs.io/en/v3.1.0/\">here</a> is a general list of guides, manuals, and tutorials about the use of DRAGONS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DRAGONS kernel has been made available in the Data Lab environment, allowing users to access the routines without being dependent on installing the software on their local machines. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we present an example of a DRAGONS Jupyter notebook that works in the Data Lab environment to reduce example Gemini South NIRI Kshort-band imaging data fully. This notebook will not present all of the details of the many options available to adjust or optimize the DRAGONS GSAOI data reduction process; rather, it will just show one example of a standard reduction of a GSAOI imaging dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this notebook example is GSAOI KshortH-band imaging from the Gemini archive of the giant elliptical galaxy NGC 5128 from the Gemini South program \"<a href=\"https://archive.gemini.edu/programinfo/GS-2017A-Q-29\">Stellar Population GeMology: Long Period Variables at High Metallicity in the Nearest Elliptical Galaxy</a>\", PI: John Blakeslee, program ID GS-2017A-Q-29. \n",
