    "# Goals\n",
    "Showcase how to reduce NIRI imaging data using the Gemini DRAGONS package on the Data Lab science platform, using a custom DRAGONS kernel `\"DRAGONS (Py3.7)\"`. The steps include downloading data from the Gemini archive, setting up a DRAGONS calibration service, processing flats, darks, a bad pixel mask, and science frames, and creating a single combined stacked image.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"summary\"></a>\n",
    "# Summary\n",
    "DRAGONS is a Python-based astronomical data reduction platform written by the Gemini Science User Support Department. It can currently be used to reduce imaging data from Gemini instruments GMOS, NIRI, Flamingos 2, GSAOI, and GNIRS, as well as spectroscopic data taken with GHOST and GMOS in longslit mode. Linked <a href=\"https://dragons.readthedocs.io/en/v3.2.1/\">here</a> is a general list of guides, manuals, and tutorials about the use of DRAGONS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DRAGONS kernel has been made available in the Data Lab environment, allowing users to access the routines without being dependent on installing the software on their local machines. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we present an example of a DRAGONS Jupyter notebook that works in the Data Lab environment to reduce example Gemini North NIRI H-band imaging data fully. This notebook will not present all of the details of the many options available to adjust or optimize the DRAGONS NIRI data reduction process; instead, it will just show one example of a standard reduction of a NIRI imaging dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this notebook example is NIRI H-band imaging from the Gemini archive of the Supernova SN2014J from the Gemini North program \"<a href=\"https://archive.gemini.edu/programinfo/GN-2015B-Q-31\">SN2014J at very late phases</a>\", PI: Marten van Kerkwijk, program ID GN-2015B-Q-31.\n",
