    "Showcase how to reduce GNIRS L-band Longslit point source data using the Gemini DRAGONS package on the Data Lab science platform using a custom DRAGONS kernel `\"DRAGONS-4.0.0 (DL,Py3.12)\"`. The steps include downloading data from the Gemini archive, setting up a DRAGONS calibration service, processing flats, darks, a bad pixel mask, and science frames, and displaying the reduced 1D spectrum. \n",

    "<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"summary\"></a>\n",
    "# Summary\n",
    "DRAGONS is a Python-based astronomical data reduction platform written by the Gemini Science User Support Department. It can currently be used to reduce imaging data from Gemini instruments GMOS, NIRI, Flamingos 2, GSAOI, and GNIRS, as well as spectroscopic data taken with GNIRS, GHOST, and GMOS in longslit mode. Linked <a href=\"https://gnirsls-drtutorial.readthedocs.io/en/v4.0.0/index.html\">here</a> is a general list of guides, manuals, and tutorials about the use of DRAGONS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DRAGONS kernel has been made available in the Data Lab environment, allowing users to access the routines without being dependent on installing the software on their local machines. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we present an example of a DRAGONS Jupyter notebook that works in the Data Lab environment to reduce example Gemini North GNIRS L-band data. This notebook will not present all the details of the many options available to adjust or optimize the DRAGONS GNIRS data reduction process, including the interactive features; rather, it will just show one example of a standard reduction. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this notebook example is GNIRS L-band Longslit Point Source spectroscopy from the Gemini archive of the Be-star HD41335 from the Gemini North program  \"<a href=\"https://archive.gemini.edu/programinfo/GN-2017B-Q-81\">Structure and physical properties of circumestellar envelopes of Be stars</a>\", PI: Yanina Cochetti, program ID GN-2017B-Q-81. \n",

    "The telluric standard observed before the science observation is âhip 28910â. The spectral type of the star is A0V.\n",

    "To properly calculate and fit a telluric model to the star, we need to know its effective temperature. To properly scale the sensitivity function (to use the star as a spectrophotometric standard), we need to know the starâs magnitude. Those are inputs to the fitTelluric primitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default effective temperature of 9650 K is typical of an A0V star, which is the most common spectral type used as a telluric standard. Different sources give values between 9500 K and 9750 K and, for example, Eric Mamajekâs list âA Modern Mean Dwarf Stellar Color and Effective Temperature Sequenceâ (https://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/EEM_dwarf_UBVIJHK_colors_Teff.txt) quotes the effective temperature of an A0V star as 9700 K. The precise value has only a small effect on the derived sensitivity and even less effect on the telluric correction, so the temperature from any reliable source can be used. Using Simbad, we find that the star has a magnitude of K=4.523, which is the closest waveband to our observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the data are recognized by Astrodata as normal GNIRS longslit science spectra. To calculate the telluric correction, we need to specify the telluric recipe (reduceTelluric), otherwise the default science reduction will be run."
