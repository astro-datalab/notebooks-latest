    "Showcase how to perform GNIRS keyhole imaging data reduction using the Gemini DRAGONS package on the Data Lab science platform. Uses a custom DRAGONS kernel `\"DRAGONS (Py3.7)\"`. The steps include downloading data from the Gemini archive, setting up a DRAGONS calibration service, processing of flats, darks, and science frames, and finally the creation of a single combined stacked image.\n",

    "DRAGONS is a Python-based astronomical data reduction platform written by the Gemini Science User Support Department. It can currently be used to reduce imaging data from Gemini instruments GMOS, NIRI, Flamingos 2, GSAOI, and GNIRS, as well as spectroscopic data in GMOS longslit mode. Linked here is a general list of guides, manuals, and tutorials about the use of DRAGONS:\n",

    "The DRAGONS kernel has been made available in the Data Lab environment, allowing users to access the routines without being dependent on installing the software on their local machines. \n",

    "This notebook will not present all of the details of the many options available to adjust or optimize the DRAGONS GNIRS data reduction process; rather, it will just show one example of a standard reduction of a GNIRS imaging dataset. \n",
