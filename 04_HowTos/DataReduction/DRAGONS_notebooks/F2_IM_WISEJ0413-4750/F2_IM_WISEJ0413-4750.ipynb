    "Showcase how to perform Flamingos-2 imaging data reduction using the Gemini DRAGONS package on the Data Lab science platform. Uses a custom DRAGONS kernel `\"DRAGONS (Py3.7)\"`. The steps include downloading data from the Gemini archive, setting up a DRAGONS calibration service, processing of flats, darks, bad pixel mask, and science frames, and finally the creation of a single combined stacked image.\n",

    "DRAGONS is a Python-based astronomical data reduction platform written by the Gemini Science User Support Department. It currently can be used to reduce imaging data from Gemini instruments GMOS, NIRI, Flamingos 2, GSAOI, and GNIRS, and spectroscopic data in GMOS longslit mode. Linked here is a general list of guides, manuals, and tutorials about the use of DRAGONS:\n",
    "https://dragons.readthedocs.io/en/v3.1.0/\n",

    "The DRAGONS kernel has been made available in the Data Lab environment, which should allow users to access the routines without being dependent on installing the software in their local machines. \n",

    "This notebook will not present all of the details of the many options available to adjust or optimize the DRAGONS Flamingos-2 data reduction process, rather will just show one example of a standard reduction of a Flamingos-2 imaging dataset. \n",
