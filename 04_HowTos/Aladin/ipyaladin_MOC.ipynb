    "Aladin Lite is an interactive sky atlas that runs in your browser. Aladin can be used to explore the sky and has built-in functionality that makes it possible to overlay images onto the viewer and identify objects included in databases. This notebook will demonstrate how to create and overlay several MOCs onto Aladin, which would help identify overlapping datasets. \n",

    "# Querying the Astro Data Lab \n",
    "\n",
    "To access the data we will use to create the MOCs, we must draft some [ADQL](https://datalab.noirlab.edu/img/ADQL-20081030.pdf) queries. Like SQL, the general format of an ADQL query uses at least three commands: SELECT, FROM, and WHERE. SELECT identifies which columns you want to extract data from, FROM identifies which table you want to pull the columns from, and WHERE allows you to put constraints on your search (such as only select rows WHERE the magnitude is less than 20.0). \n",
    "\n",
    "We are essentially using the Astro Data Lab's [Web query interface](https://datalab.noirlab.edu/query.php) ([click here to view the web query interface user manual](https://datalab.noirlab.edu/docs/manual/UsingAstroDataLab/WebPortal/DataExplorer/WebQuery/WebQuery.html?highlight=query%20interface)) tool to obtain the data. One power feature of this tool is that you can go through the tap schema for every table hosted by the Data Lab. This is an important tool to become familiar with because most of the surveys that the Data Lab hosts contain multiple data releases, each of which can contain multiple tables. For instance, the SMASH survey has two data releases. We are interested in the second data release, but this release contains 11 tables. We are interested in the object table, so our FROM command should look like this: FROM smash_dr2.object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know which table we are interested in, we must identify which columns to pull data from. Clicking on smash_dr2.object in the tap schema will open a new tab in the Query Interface tool, Column Information. Here, you will find all the columns in the table followed by a brief description and their data types. For this tutorial, we will be interested in the columns corresponding to the coordinates (ra and dec), g band magnitudes (mag_auto_g), and random_id. So our SELECT command should look like: SELECT ra, dec, mag_auto_g, random_id. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before continuing, it is important to note that although columns like ra and dec will appear in most tables, their names can change depending on the table you are working with. For the SMASH table we are working with here, they are listed as ra and dec, but if we were using the euclid_ero.fornax_vis table, we would need to call alpha_j2000 and delta_j2000\n",
    "\n",
    "All the tables hosted by the Data Lab greatly vary in size, but most are very large. So, we will need to modify our SELECT command so it doesn't select every row of the table. We will use the TOP command to do this, which only returns the top x  values from a specified column (where x is a specific integer value). So our SELECT command can be rewritten as: SELECT TOP 25000 ra, dec, mag_auto_g, random_id.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need to establish our search constraints using WHERE. To create the MOC for this table, we could select every row in the table and identify the boundaries of the table, but the smash_dr2.object table has 360,201,921 rows which would not only take a long time to download, but a table of this size would crash the Jupyter Notebook and Aladin Lite. To avoid this, we are going to utilize the random_id column. As the name implies, this column contains a unique random ID for each row whose values are floats in the range 0.0 and 100.0. Because the table is so large, we only need to establish a small window, say between 25.0 and 25.01. To use the WHERE command, we need to provide a column that the constraint will be applied to (random_id) and a constraint. In this case, our constraint is to only select rows whose random_id values are BETWEEN 25.0 and 25.01. So our WHERE command will look like: WHERE random_id BETWEEN 25.0 AND 25.01.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting all of this together leaves us with the following query:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT TOP 25000 ra, dec, gmag, random_id FROM smash_dr2.object WHERE random_id BETWEEN 25.0 AND 25.01\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have an ADQL query prepared for SMASH, we will need to repeat the process to query the DECaPS and DES surveys. If you find yourself getting stuck with SQL/ADQL, you can visit the following link to learn about common [SQL Gotchas](https://datalab.noirlab.edu/docs/manual/UsingAstroDataLab/SQLGotchas/index.html?highlight=sql)."
