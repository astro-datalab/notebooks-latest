 <h1>Minor Planet Ephemeris Service: Query Results</h1>
 Below are the results of your request from the Minor Planet Center's
 Minor Planet Ephemeris Service.
 <p>
   Newly designated objects may take up to 1 day to show up in this service.
 </p>
 <p>
   Orbits and ephemerides of unnumbered NEOs are up-to-date. Other orbits are in
  the process of being refreshed.
 </p>
 <p>
   The current system is not completely reliable in the case of objects
   with very-close approaches with the Earth.
   <br></br> We are working on a completely new system,
   but for the time being we encourage the users to double check
   the results with other ephemeris generators when the object is very close to 
 Earth.
 </p>
 Ephemerides are for
 observatory code 106.
