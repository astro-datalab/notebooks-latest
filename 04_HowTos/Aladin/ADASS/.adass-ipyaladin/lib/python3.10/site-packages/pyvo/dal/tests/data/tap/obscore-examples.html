    <h1>ObsCore Examples from Heidelberg</h1>
    <p>These are examples for ADQL you can run in TAP services carrying
      an <code>ivoa.obscore</code> table.  See
      <a href="http://ivoa.net/documents/ObsCore/">ObsCore</a> for the underlying
      data model.</p>
   <div typeof="example" id="Findingplatesbytimeandplace" resource="#Findingplatesbytimeandplace">
    <h2 property="name">Finding images by time and place</h2>
    <p>Suppose you read in an old amateur observer's log there was an unexpected
object on the night sky in the cold winter nights of the week between January
12th and 18th, 1903 &#x2013; and now you would like to see whether there could
be an observation of such a thing.</p>
         <pre class="literal-block">
SELECT s_ra, s_dec, t_min FROM ivoa.obscore
  WHERE t_min BETWEEN gavo_to_mjd('1903-01-12')
      AND gavo_to_mjd('1903-01-19')
</pre>
     <p>There is also a shortcut via user defined functions.  As an extension
to regular ADQL, DaCHS lets you write gavo_simbadpoint('object') and replaces
the result with a position obtained from simbad, like this:</p>
        <pre class="dachs-ex-tapquery literal-block" property="query">
SELECT access_url, t_exptime, t_min FROM ivoa.obscore
  WHERE
    t_min BETWEEN gavo_to_mjd('J2416128.5')
      AND gavo_to_mjd('J2416133.5') AND
    1=CONTAINS(gavo_simbadpoint('Aldebaran'),
      CIRCLE('ICRS', s_ra, s_dec, 15))
</pre>
		</div>
	</body>
