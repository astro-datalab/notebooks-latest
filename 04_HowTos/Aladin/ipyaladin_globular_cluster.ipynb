    "# Goals\n",
    "Demonstrate how to display image and catalog data with the AladinLite Viewer in a notebook (using ipyaladin). The image and catalog data will be obtained through Data Lab's data services.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"summary\"></a>\n",
    "# Summary\n",
    "<a href=\"https://aladin.cds.unistra.fr/AladinLite/doc/\">AladinLite</a> is an interactive sky atlas that runs in your browser. Aladin allows users to explore the sky and display images. Additionally, it enables the overlay of catalog objects, facilitating object identification. <a href=\"https://github.com/cds-astro/ipyaladin\">ipyaladin</a> was created to allow Jupyter Notebooks to utilize Aladin Lite's functionality. This notebook will demonstrate how to use ipyaladin to display images and overlay survey catalog data, which would help identify overlapping datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizing surveys like this allows users to explore whether a source of interest has already been observed by a survey. By executing a cone search and overlaying the found objects, one can check if sources visible in images have counterparts in specific catalogs, which can be beneficial when preparing a telescope proposal. \n",

    "According to [Edward W.

So, we will perform a cone search centered on the globular cluster with a radius of 0.1 degrees. \n",

    "The SkyMapper survey contains tens of thousands of data points within our search cone. If we were to overlay the data points as they are, the image would be obscured by a blanket of data markers, completely blocking our view of the globular cluster. To resolve this, we will apply a magnitude cutoff to our query so that only sources with z band magnitudes less than 17 are returned, reducing the number of regions we overlay onto Aladin. "
