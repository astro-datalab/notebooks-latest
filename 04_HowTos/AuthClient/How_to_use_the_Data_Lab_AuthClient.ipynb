    "This notebook documents how to use the Data Lab authorization system via the *Auth Client* service. This can be done either from a Python script or from the command line using the <i>datalab</i> command.\n",
    "\n",
    "While most Data Lab services may be accessed anonymously, others require a valid user account in order to take advantage of resources such as <i>Virtual Storage</i> or <i>Compute Services</i>.  User accounts may be created on the main Data Lab website and are not discussed here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming an account has been created, the <i><b>authClient</b></i> interface can be used to authenticate yourself to the Data Lab to obtain an identity token used to access the resources allocated to the account.  This is typically the first step in any notebook or application, the returned token is then passed to every other interface method that requires authenticated access to a resource or service.\n",
    "\n",
