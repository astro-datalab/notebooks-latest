    "\n",
    "This notebook documents how to query the Data Lab via the query client service. For full documentation see the <a href=\"https://datalab.noirlab.edu/docs/api/dl.html#module-dl.queryClient\">API documentation</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The *queryClient* class\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All queries are executed through the *queryClient.query()* method of the *queryClient* class. This takes as arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Argument | Description | Optional | Default  value | Supported Values |\n",
    "|----------|-------------|----------|----------------|----------------|\n",
    "| adql | The query to be submitted to the TAP service | No | None | string |\n",
    "| sql | The query to be submitted to the DB directly | Yes | None | string |\n",
    "| fmt | The requested format (if any) | Yes | ascii | ascii,csv,fits,hdf5,votable |\n",
    "| out | The saved location (if any) | Yes | None | local filename, *vos://filename*, *mydb://tablename* |\n",
    "| async_ | Indicates if the query is asynchronous | Yes | False | True/False |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All arguments are optional, except that one of *adql* or *sql* must be supplied.  The distinction between these two parameters is in how the *QueryClient* executes the query:  If *adql* is provided the query is sent to the TAP (Table Access Protocol) service, if *sql* is provided the query is sent directly to the database. The choice of execution depends on whether the query string contains ADQL-specific functions, or SQL constructs or DB extensions not understood by the TAP service.  For large queries there can also be a performance difference depending on the where/how the results are saved. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output formats\n",
    "The results can be returned as whitespace delimited (*ascii*), CSV (*csv*), FITS object (*fits*), HDF5 (*hdf5*), or in VOTable format (*votable*). Note that if the results are saved to the user's database then the output format is ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Saving results\n",
    "If no save location is specified (no *out* param) then the results are returned directly. A save location beginning with the 'vos://' identifier indicates a location in the user's virtual storage to save the result. A save location beginning with the 'mydb://' identifier indicates the results are to be saved to a table in the user's remote database (MyDB). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Asynchronous queries\n",
    "Long queries should be run asynchronously and the service may refuse any synchronous query attempted if the projected query time is too long. A query can be submitted asynchronously by setting the *async_* parameter to *True*. A job id will then be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "The status of an asynchronous query can be checked with *queryClient.status(jobid)*. A return value of 'COMPLETED' indicates the query has terminated. A return value of 'ERROR' indicates that there was a problem with the query.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The results of an asynchronous query (assuming that they were not saved to either the user's virtual storage or remote database) can be retrieved once the query has completed with *result = qc.query(adql=query,async_=True,wait=True,poll=1,verbose=1)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### From Python code\n",
    "\n",
    "The query client service can be called from Python code using the *datalab* module. This provides methods to access the various query client functions in the *QueryClient* subpackage. See the information [here](https://github.com/astro-datalab/datalab/blob/master/README.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "Queries can be also run from the command line, e.g. on your local machine, using the datalab command line utility. Read about it in our GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/astro-datalab/datalab).\n"
